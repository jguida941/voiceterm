## 8. Known gaps and open items

- open governance findings: 42

### Startup advisories
- push_allowed: worktree_clean_and_review_accepted

### Stale warnings
- Stop because nothing remains to push.

### Open gap rows
- **governance_open** (`dev/scripts/devctl/commands/review_channel`): review_channel.command_latency_under_fanout: source_packet_ids=rev_pkt_2704,rev_pkt_2705; review-channel post and startup-context can hang under multi-agent load, tied to process-cleanup and detached sleep pressure.

Projection produced by `devctl review-snapshot`. Generation stamp `snap-bc1d29a94e63` binds this file to HEAD `252ca280ec9f`; if they drift, the freshness guard will fail CI. When the latest commit only refreshes this generated snapshot, the guard accepts this file as bound to that commit's parent code state.
