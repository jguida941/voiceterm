- contract slice for MP-355 plus the temporary markdown-swarm operating mode
- 2026-05-11 slice 18 fix arc + bilateral protocol consolidation (MP-377):
- 2026-05-14 launch-bootstrap repair family (MP-378): after the relaunch

- companion under `MP-376`, not a second main product plan; implementation
- 2026-04-18 `MP-399` governed commit staged-index preservation in `MP-377`
- 2026-04-18 `MP-410` devctl root package-layout relief in `MP-377` scope:

Projection produced by `devctl review-snapshot`. Generation stamp `snap-4adf64d0cb48` binds this file to HEAD `3a98de578a1b`; if they drift, the freshness guard will fail CI. When the latest commit only refreshes this generated snapshot, the guard accepts this file as bound to that commit's parent code state.
