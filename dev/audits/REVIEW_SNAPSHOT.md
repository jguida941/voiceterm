Projection produced by `devctl review-snapshot`. Generation stamp `snap-971673a6404a` binds this file to HEAD `bd76e5a81208`; if they drift, the freshness guard will fail CI. When the latest commit only refreshes this generated snapshot, the guard accepts this file as bound to that commit's parent code state.
