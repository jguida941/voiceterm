## 1. Identity

- Repository: **VoiceTerm**
- Product thesis: This is the product thesis for the governance stack in this repository.
Absorb these four commitments before engaging with SOP, guard, routing,

Projection produced by `devctl review-snapshot`. Generation stamp `snap-3ec6f57b94e3` binds this file to HEAD `37eb2d7802ef`; if they drift, the freshness guard will fail CI. When the latest commit only refreshes this generated snapshot, the guard accepts this file as bound to that commit's parent code state.
