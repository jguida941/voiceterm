## 1. Identity

- Repository: **VoiceTerm**
- Product thesis: This is the product thesis for the governance stack in this repository.
Absorb these four commitments before engaging with SOP, guard, routing,
or plan detail — they explain why the process exists.

This repo builds a portable AI governance platform proven through one
production client (VoiceTerm, a Rust voice-first terminal overlay for AI
CLIs). The product thesis is that executable local control — guards,
probes, typed actions, deterministic policy resolution — is what makes
AI-assisted engineering reliable, not prompt instructions alone.

**Mission**: Ship a reusable governance stack that any repo can adopt by
installing the platform and selecting a repo pack, without forking
VoiceTerm-specific code.

**Proof obligation**: Every claim about quality, safety, or process
compliance must be backed by a repo-owned executable artifact (guard
script, probe, typed action, CI workflow) that produces the same result
regardless of which AI model or operator runs it. Prompt-only governance
is not accepted as proof.

**Platform boundaries**: VoiceTerm is one client of the platform; portable
governance layers must not hardcode repo names, bridge paths, plan doc
locations, or product-specific defaults. Repo-local assumptions belong in
the repo pack, not in the platform core. MCP servers, operator consoles,
mobile surfaces, and overlay/TUI adapters are clients, not authority.

**Current priority**: Harden the governance stack for multi-repo adoption —
remove VoiceTerm-local assumptions from portable layers, stabilize the
typed contract surface (ProjectGovernance, StartupContext, ReviewState,
TypedAction → ActionResult → RunRecord), and close the remaining probe
and guard gaps so the platform proves its own thesis before external
adopters arrive.

## 7. Reasoning — why these changes landed

### Per-commit rationale

- **`53e06b4b`** — docs(audit): Q57-Q59 — monitor pass, registry dispatcher, human UX
  - Q57: No canonical single-pass monitor for remote phone mode. Agent
  - manually stitches multiple commands. Need devctl monitor --mode
  - remote_phone that returns all state in one typed mobile-safe pass.
  - evolution: Fact: the Q40/Q42 live-run findings showed two separate authority leaks. A dashboard/observer lane could still slide into implementation edits while another agent owned the active lane, and recovery code could escalate …
- **`862ebd16`** — docs(audit): Q56 — Q54+Q55 compose from existing systems, minimal wiring
  - Research confirmed: self-audit (Q54) needs 1 line in VALID_SIGNAL_TYPES
  - + optional finding_type field. Priority engine (Q55) reuses triage
  - SEVERITY_ORDER + context-graph dependency edges. No new tools needed.

- **`306116c6`** — docs(audit): Q54 — observer layer ungoverned, no self-audit loop
  - The system governs state/review/commit/push but not HOW the observer

Projection produced by `devctl review-snapshot`. Generation stamp `snap-2ec815810f58` binds this file to HEAD `53e06b4b0596`; if they drift, the freshness guard will fail CI. When the latest commit only refreshes this generated snapshot, the guard accepts this file as bound to that commit's parent code state.
