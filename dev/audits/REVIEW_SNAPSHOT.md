## 1. Identity

- Repository: **VoiceTerm**
- Product thesis: This is the product thesis for the governance stack in this repository.
Absorb these four commitments before engaging with SOP, guard, routing,
or plan detail — they explain why the process exists.

This repo builds a portable AI governance platform proven through one
production client (VoiceTerm, a Rust voice-first terminal overlay for AI
CLIs). The product thesis is that executable local control — guards,
probes, typed actions, deterministic policy resolution — is what makes
AI-assisted engineering reliable, not prompt instructions alone.

**Mission**: Ship a reusable governance stack that any repo can adopt by
installing the platform and selecting a repo pack, without forking
VoiceTerm-specific code.

**Proof obligation**: Every claim about quality, safety, or process
compliance must be backed by a repo-owned executable artifact (guard
script, probe, typed action, CI workflow) that produces the same result
regardless of which AI model or operator runs it. Prompt-only governance
is not accepted as proof.

**Platform boundaries**: VoiceTerm is one client of the platform; portable
governance layers must not hardcode repo names, bridge paths, plan doc
locations, or product-specific defaults. Repo-local assumptions belong in
the repo pack, not in the platform core. MCP servers, operator consoles,
mobile surfaces, and overlay/TUI adapters are clients, not authority.

**Current priority**: Harden the governance stack for multi-repo adoption —
remove VoiceTerm-local assumptions from portable layers, stabilize the
typed contract surface (ProjectGovernance, StartupContext, ReviewState,
TypedAction → ActionResult → RunRecord), and close the remaining probe
and guard gaps so the platform proves its own thesis before external
adopters arrive.
