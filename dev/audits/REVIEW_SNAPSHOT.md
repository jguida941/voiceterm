- **`f2f152dd`** — Phase 0A: bridge and boot-card projection kill-switch
- **`b161e95b`** — Phase 0.6.C: AGENTS.md vs CLAUDE.md projection-parity violation captured
  - Operator-mandated 2026-05-18T~18:00 EDT. Empirical evidence that the topology-hardcode-via-projection bug source is dev/scripts/devctl/governance/instruction_boot_card.py — the template that generates AGENTS.md AND CLAUDE.md from render-surfaces. Both projections SHOULD be byte-equal (modulo surface_id marker) since any agent can play any role per cached-hammock P58.5, but they currently diverge on 8 lines hardcoding --role reviewer --actor codex (AGENTS.md) vs --role implementer --actor claude (CLAUDE.md).
- **`286b8703`** — Phase 0.6.A: add alias-authority-parity guardrail
  - Operator-mandated 2026-05-18T~17:45 EDT. Single guardrail added to Phase 0.6.A green criteria: no command alias may parse into a different authority model than /develop. /goal, /check-it, /archive-evidence, /session-log must be adapters into the SAME typed path as /develop, not parallel command systems. Regression test: byte-for-byte packet/event payload equality (modulo timestamp/id) between alias invocation and canonical /develop action.
- **`87f1248e`** — Narrow Phase 0.6 to entrypoint, bridge containment, and topology guards
  - Plan-only correction per operator scope-discipline directive 2026-05-18T~17:30 EDT. Phase 0.6 is scoped to bounded substrate guardrails before Phase 1 proof-integrity, not full bridge retirement or full N-agent topology refactor.
- **`815901f4`** — Refresh external review snapshot for b16d00a4
- **`b16d00a4`** — Phase 0.4-Bootstrap IMPLEMENTATION: launcher + post authority-ordering fix
  - Operator-issued 2026-05-18T~17:30 EDT. This commit lands the Phase 0.4-Bootstrap implementation files codex shipped during exec session (PID 61481, session 019e3cc2-c993-75c1-851a-24866d133b5d). Prior commit b85ed85a was the Phase 0.6 PLAN AMENDMENT only — this commit makes the Phase 0.4 IMPLEMENTATION durable on GuardIR extraction branch.
- **`b85ed85a`** — Phase 0.6 amendment: Entry-Point Hardening + Bridge Retirement + Role-Based Topology
  - Operator amendment 2026-05-18T~17:00 EDT. Threads three architectural root-cause concerns already specified in cached-hammock plan into canonical extraction plan as Phase 0.6 (lands BEFORE Phase 1 P0 proof-integrity).
### Active MP scope (from MASTER_PLAN.md)

- contract slice for MP-355 plus the temporary markdown-swarm operating mode
- 2026-05-11 slice 18 fix arc + bilateral protocol consolidation (MP-377):
- 2026-05-14 launch-bootstrap repair family (MP-378): after the relaunch
- `dev/active/review_probes.md` is the review-probe execution spec; implementation tasks stay in this file under `MP-368..MP-375`.
- companion under `MP-376`, not a second main product plan; implementation
- 2026-04-18 `MP-399` governed commit staged-index preservation in `MP-377`
- 2026-04-18 `MP-410` devctl root package-layout relief in `MP-377` scope:
- 2026-04-18 `MP-398` push preflight staged-index exclusion in `MP-377`
- 2026-04-18 `MP-388` consolidation archive pass in `MP-377` scope:
