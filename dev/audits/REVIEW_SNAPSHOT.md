## 1. Identity

- Repository: **VoiceTerm**
- Product thesis: This is the product thesis for the governance stack in this repository.
Absorb these four commitments before engaging with SOP, guard, routing,
or plan detail — they explain why the process exists.

This repo builds a portable AI governance platform proven through one
production client (VoiceTerm, a Rust voice-first terminal overlay for AI
CLIs). The product thesis is that executable local control — guards,
probes, typed actions, deterministic policy resolution — is what makes
AI-assisted engineering reliable, not prompt instructions alone.

**Mission**: Ship a reusable governance stack that any repo can adopt by
installing the platform and selecting a repo pack, without forking
VoiceTerm-specific code.

**Proof obligation**: Every claim about quality, safety, or process
compliance must be backed by a repo-owned executable artifact (guard
script, probe, typed action, CI workflow) that produces the same result
regardless of which AI model or operator runs it. Prompt-only governance
is not accepted as proof.

**Platform boundaries**: VoiceTerm is one client of the platform; portable
governance layers must not hardcode repo names, bridge paths, plan doc
locations, or product-specific defaults. Repo-local assumptions belong in
the repo pack, not in the platform core. MCP servers, operator consoles,
mobile surfaces, and overlay/TUI adapters are clients, not authority.

**Current priority**: Harden the governance stack for multi-repo adoption —
remove VoiceTerm-local assumptions from portable layers, stabilize the
typed contract surface (ProjectGovernance, StartupContext, ReviewState,
TypedAction → ActionResult → RunRecord), and close the remaining probe
and guard gaps so the platform proves its own thesis before external
adopters arrive.

### Push decision
- action: `await_checkpoint`
- reason: staged_index_budget_exceeded
- push_eligible_now: False
- worktree_clean: False
- staged_path_count: 157
- unstaged_path_count: 0

- latest_push_report: `dev/reports/push/latest.json`
- latest_push_report_state: `blocked` (validation_failed)
- publication_backlog: queued
- publication_guidance: Local branch still has unpublished work waiting for governed push once the current slice is checkpoint-clean.

### Reviewer runtime

### Per-commit rationale

- **`687c0478`** — Refresh external review snapshot for 4372e2cd

  - stamps delivery_emitted_at_utc / delivery_observed_at_utc / delivery_observed_by
  - plan: `dev/active/review_channel.md`
- **`a3e3347c`** — docs(audit): dashboard-loop tick 1-32 + typed findings 0200-0237
  - Durable audit trail from this remote-dashboard session covering:
  - - 32 dashboard-loop ticks with verbatim typed state, parity matrix,
  -   agent-mind cursor polls, and target-file mtime deltas
### Active MP scope (from MASTER_PLAN.md)

- `dev/active/devctl_reporting_upgrade.md` is the phased `devctl` reporting/CIHub specification, but not a separate execution tracker; implementation tasks stay in this file under `MP-297..MP-300`, `MP-303`, `MP-306`, `MP…
- `dev/active/autonomous_control_plane.md` is the autonomous loop + mobile control-plane execution spec; implementation tasks stay in this file under `MP-325..MP-338, MP-340`.
- `dev/active/loop_chat_bridge.md` is the loop artifact-to-chat suggestion coordination runbook; execution evidence and operator handoffs for this path stay there under `MP-338`.
- `dev/active/naming_api_cohesion.md` is the naming/API cohesion execution spec; implementation tasks stay in this file under `MP-267`.
- `dev/active/ide_provider_modularization.md` is the IDE/provider adapter modularization execution spec; implementation tasks stay in this file under `MP-346`, `MP-354`.
- contract slice for MP-355 plus the temporary markdown-swarm operating mode
- `dev/active/ralph_guardrail_control_plane.md` is the Ralph guardrail control plane execution spec; implementation tasks stay in this file under `MP-360..MP-367`.
- `dev/active/review_probes.md` is the review-probe execution spec; implementation tasks stay in this file under `MP-368..MP-375`.
- companion under `MP-376`, not a second main product plan; implementation
- architecture plan for the extracted AI-governance system under `MP-377`.

## 8. Known gaps and open items

- open governance findings: 95

### Startup advisories
- checkpoint_before_continue: staged_index_budget_exceeded

### Stale warnings
- Keep editing the current slice.
- Move straight to the governed push path.

### Open gap rows
- **governance_open** (`dev/scripts/devctl/commands/loop_packet.py`): none_safety_chained_get_crash: 
- **governance_open** (`dev/scripts/devctl/commands/dashboard_summary.py`): none_safety_chained_get_crash:

- **governance_open** (`dev/scripts/devctl/runtime/startup_signals.py`): startup_probe_path_bug: Reads dev/reports/probes/summary.json (DOES NOT EXIST). Should read dev/reports/probes/latest/summary.json. Startup quality_signals never includes probe data.
- **governance_open** (`dev/scripts/devctl/commands/check/phases.py`): guard_probe_data_isolation: Guards run in run_setup_phase, probes run in run_probe_phase. Zero data flows between them. Code-shape clusters recalculated by probes independently. Probe results not consumed by startup, planning-ir, session-resume, or quality-feedback.

Projection produced by `devctl review-snapshot`. Generation stamp `snap-ac19182dad5a` binds this file to HEAD `687c04784daa`; if they drift, the freshness guard will fail CI. When the latest commit only refreshes this generated snapshot, the guard accepts this file as bound to that commit's parent code state.
