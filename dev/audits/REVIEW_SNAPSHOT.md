## 1. Identity

- Repository: **VoiceTerm**
- Product thesis: This is the product thesis for the governance stack in this repository.
Absorb these four commitments before engaging with SOP, guard, routing,
or plan detail — they explain why the process exists.

This repo builds a portable AI governance platform proven through one
production client (VoiceTerm, a Rust voice-first terminal overlay for AI
CLIs). The product thesis is that executable local control — guards,
probes, typed actions, deterministic policy resolution — is what m...

Durable owner: MP377-GUARDIR-TRANSITION-DISAMBIGUATION.

Durable owner: MP377-GUARDIR-PACKET-DURABLE-INGESTION.
- **governance_open** (`dev/scripts/checks/multi_agent_sync`): agent_sync.ambiguity_projection: source_packet_ids=rev_pkt_2697,rev_pkt_2705; canonical_active_packet_ambiguity can render empty while ambiguity exists, and expired-but-pending split state creates carry-forward debt. Durable owner: MP377-GUARDIR-AGENT-SYNC-AMBIGUITY-CARRYFORWARD.
- **governance_open** (`dev/scripts/devctl/commands/review_channel`): review_channel.command_latency_under_fanout: source_packet_ids=rev_pkt_2704,rev_pkt_2705; review-channel post and startup-context can hang under multi-agent load, tied to process-cleanup and detached sleep pressure. Durable owner: MP377-GUARDIR-FANOUT-COMMAND-HANGS.
- **governance_open** (`dev/scripts/devctl/runtime/agent_dispatch_router.py`): work_board.rows_duplication: source_packet_ids=rev_pkt_2700,rev_pkt_2705; _work_board_rows logic is duplicated between packet_route_resolution.py and agent_dispatch_router.py.

Projection produced by `devctl review-snapshot`. Generation stamp `snap-ea1720f5753f` binds this file to HEAD `3769a6c29b05`; if they drift, the freshness guard will fail CI. When the latest commit only refreshes this generated snapshot, the guard accepts this file as bound to that commit's parent code state.
