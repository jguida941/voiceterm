# Archive

This folder stores completed work items pulled from the active master plan.

## Retention policy
- Keep archive entries. They are immutable historical records for audits/release decisions.
- Do not delete archive files just to reduce LLM context; keep active execution in
  `dev/active/MASTER_PLAN.md` and treat this folder as reference-only.
- If history grows, add summary/index docs rather than removing original entries.

## How to use
- When work is completed, add a dated entry file here (YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md).
- Include a brief summary and the completed checklist items.
- Link back to the source doc(s) when helpful (audit, review, issue, PR).
- Keep the master plan current by removing completed items and linking the archive entry.
