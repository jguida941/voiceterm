## Scope

This document is generated by `devctl audit-scaffold` when modularity or
best-practice guardrails fail. It is the execution surface for remediation
planning and implementation, not a historical archive.

## Required Sources

- `AGENTS.md`
- `dev/DEVELOPMENT.md`
- `dev/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `dev/active/MASTER_PLAN.md`
- `dev/active/INDEX.md`
- `rust/Cargo.toml`

## Guard Summary

| Guard | Focus | Severity | Return | Violations | Status |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| `code-shape-guard` | modularity | high | 0 | 0 | clean |
| `rust-lint-debt-guard` | lint debt | high | 1 | 1 | needs remediation |
| `rust-best-practices-guard` | best practices | high | 1 | 1 | needs remediation |
| `rust-audit-patterns-guard` | known audit regressions | critical | 0 | 0 | clean |

## Findings

### rust-lint-debt-guard
- Focus: lint debt
- Severity: high
- Return code: 1
- Violations:
- `rust/src/bin/voiceterm/theme_studio/borders_page.rs` (allow_attrs +2)

### rust-best-practices-guard
- Focus: best practices
- Severity: high
- Return code: 1
- Violations:
- `rust/src/bin/voiceterm/theme_studio/borders_page.rs` (allow_without_reason +2)

## Remediation Actions

- [ ] Reduce newly introduced `#[allow(...)]` and non-test `unwrap/expect` growth reported by `rust-lint-debt-guard`.
- [ ] Add missing `reason=` for `#[allow(...)]`, document `unsafe` with `SAFETY:` comments, and add `# Safety` docs for public `unsafe fn` where reported.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Fixes implemented for all actionable findings.
- [ ] `python3 dev/scripts/devctl.py check --profile ai-guard` passes.
- [ ] Task-class bundle and risk-matrix checks pass.
- [ ] Docs and plan entries updated for behavior/process changes.
- [ ] Scaffold closed or regenerated with zero open findings.
