# App Launchers

Platform-specific application launchers for VoiceTerm.

## macOS

`macos/VoiceTerm.app` - Double-click app that opens a folder picker and launches VoiceTerm in Terminal.

**Usage:**

1. Double-click `VoiceTerm.app`
2. Select your project folder
3. Terminal opens with VoiceTerm running in that folder

**Building:** The app is a simple AppleScript wrapper. No build step required.

## Windows

`windows/` - Windows launcher (coming soon)

**Planned features:**

- Windows Terminal integration
- PowerShell launcher
- WSL2 support

## Control-Plane Direction

Operator control surfaces stay Rust-first in this repo:

- runtime UI/voice/PTY behavior is the Rust overlay
- operator actions route through `devctl` and policy-gated controller commands
- phone/SSH views consume `controller_state` projections
