# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs capture the "why" behind key technical decisions so we can revisit them later
without re-litigating old context. Keep them short, factual, and specific.

Location
- Store ADRs in this folder: `docs/dev/adr/`

Naming
- `NNNN-short-title.md` (4-digit, zero-padded)
- Example: `0001-voice-pipeline-thresholds.md`

Template
- Start from `docs/dev/adr/0000-template.md`.

Statuses
- Proposed
- Accepted
- Deprecated
- Superseded (include link to the replacement ADR)

Process
1) Copy the template and increment the number.
2) Fill in Context, Decision, and Consequences.
3) Add links to related docs or issues if they exist.
