## Status Messages

### No speech detected

The mic recorded but no voice was heard above the threshold.

**Fixes:**
1. Speak louder or closer to the mic
2. Lower the threshold: press `Ctrl+\` to make it more sensitive
3. Run `codex-voice --mic-meter` to calibrate for your environment

### Voice capture failed (see log)

The mic couldn't start recording.

**Fixes:**
1. Check mic permissions for your terminal app
2. Run `codex-voice --list-input-devices` to see available mics
3. Try a specific device: `codex-voice --input-device "Your Mic Name"`
4. Enable logs to see details: `codex-voice --logs`

### Voice capture error (see log)

Something went wrong during recording or transcription.

**Fixes:**
1. Enable logs: `codex-voice --logs`
2. Check the log at `${TMPDIR}/codex_voice_tui.log`
3. Restart `codex-voice`

### Processing... (stuck)

Transcription is taking too long.

**Fixes:**
1. Wait up to 60 seconds (large audio takes time)
2. If still stuck, press `Ctrl+C` then restart `codex-voice`
3. Try a smaller Whisper model

### Transcript queue full (oldest dropped)

You spoke 5+ times while Codex was busy. Oldest transcript was discarded.

**Fix:** Wait for Codex to finish before speaking again. Queue flushing is unreliable and tracked in the [backlog](active/BACKLOG.md).

### Voice capture already running

You pressed `Ctrl+R` while already recording.

**Fix:** Wait for the current recording to finish, or enable auto-voice (`Ctrl+V`) so you don't need to press `Ctrl+R`.

### Python pipeline

Native Whisper isn't available, using slower Python fallback. 

**Fixes:**
1. Verify model exists: `ls models/ggml-*.bin`
2. Download model: `./scripts/setup.sh models --base`
3. Or install Python dependencies: `python3`, `ffmpeg`, `whisper` CLI

## Audio Setup

### Check microphone permissions

**macOS:** System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone → Enable for your terminal app (Terminal, iTerm2, etc.)

**Linux:** Ensure your user has access to PulseAudio/PipeWire. Check with `pactl list sources`.

### Verify Whisper model exists

```bash
ls models/ggml-*.bin
```

If missing:
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh models --base
```

### List and select audio devices

```bash
codex-voice --list-input-devices
```

Use a specific device:
```bash
codex-voice --input-device "MacBook Pro Microphone"
```

### Microphone changed or unplugged

Restart `codex-voice` after plugging in a new mic. Devices are detected at startup.

---

## Mic Sensitivity

### Too sensitive (picks up background noise)

Press `Ctrl+]` to raise the threshold (less sensitive). Repeat until background noise stops triggering recordings.

Or set it at startup:
```bash
codex-voice --voice-vad-threshold-db -30
```

### Not sensitive enough (misses your voice)

Press `Ctrl+\` to lower the threshold (more sensitive).

Or set it at startup:
```bash
codex-voice --voice-vad-threshold-db -50
```

### Find the right threshold

Run the mic meter to measure your environment:
```bash
codex-voice --mic-meter
```

It samples ambient noise and your speech, then suggests a threshold.

**Range:** -80 dB (very sensitive) to -10 dB (less sensitive). Default: -40 dB.

---

## Codex Issues

### Codex not responding

1. Verify Codex CLI is installed:
   ```bash
   which codex
   ```

2. Check authentication:
   ```bash
   codex login
   ```

3. If the session is stuck, restart `codex-voice`.

---

### Auto-voice not triggering

Auto-voice waits for Codex to show a prompt before listening. If detection fails:

#### Override prompt detection

```bash
codex-voice --prompt-regex '^codex> $'
```

Adjust the regex to match your actual prompt.

#### Enable prompt logging

```bash
codex-voice --prompt-log /tmp/codex_voice_prompt.log
```

Check the log to see what lines are being detected.

---

## Install Issues

### Homebrew link conflict

If `brew install codex-voice` fails because the command already exists:

```bash
brew link --overwrite codex-voice
```

### Wrong version after update

Check for duplicate installs:
```bash
which -a codex-voice
```

Remove or rename the old one (often `~/.local/bin/codex-voice` from `./install.sh`):
```bash
mv ~/.local/bin/codex-voice ~/.local/bin/codex-voice.bak
hash -r
```

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for full PATH cleanup steps.

---

## Enabling Logs

Logs are disabled by default for privacy.

### Enable debug logging

```bash
codex-voice --logs
```

### Include transcript snippets in logs

```bash
codex-voice --logs --log-content
```

### Log file location

Debug log: `${TMPDIR}/codex_voice_tui.log` (only created when `--logs` is enabled)

### Disable all logging

```bash
codex-voice --no-logs
```
