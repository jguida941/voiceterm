# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues via GitHub Security Advisories (preferred). If that is not possible,
open an issue with minimal details and clearly mark it as a security concern.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release is supported.

## Disclosure

We will triage reports as quickly as possible and coordinate a fix before public disclosure.
